<!-- This is the first project from freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Project. It was asked not to
use any additional technologies and I have kept it within those requirements. I also did not use any
libraries as using CSS, Flex, Grid to build responsive websites were the main focus of the curriculum
here and I wanted to make sure I had these fundamentals down before using a library.
Here are the project requirments:
*You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because      *
*that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get some practice with plain CSS. You can *
*use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose. Additional technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular,*
*or Vue) are not recommended for this project, and using them is at your own risk. Other projects will *
*give you a chance to work with different technology stacks like React. We will accept and try to fix  *
*all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!-->

            “Aspire to be like Mt. Fuji, with such a broad and solid foundation that the strongest
              earthquake cannot move you, and so tall that the greatest enterprises of common men seem
              insignificant from your lofty perspective. With your mind as high as Mt Fuji you can see
              all things clearly. And you can see all the forces that shape events; not just the things
              happening near to you.”
